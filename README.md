# Scientific-calculator
A final project of school. Developing a calculator with all calculaional tearms. The reason behind developing a calculator is being a student of science, always used to use scientfic-calculaor. Now I have the chance to develop something then why not a calculaor which I was grown up using with. 
To build the project, going to use android studio. Android Studio contains everything that defines your workspace for an app, from source code and assets, to test code and build configurations.
