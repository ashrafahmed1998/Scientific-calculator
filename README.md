# A Scientific-calculator
A calculaor designed to calculate problems in science, engineering, and mathematics.
# Description and Reason of building the Calculator
A final project of school. Developing a calculator with all calculaional tearms. The reason behind developing a calculator is being a student of science, always used to use scientfic-calculaor. Now I have the chance to develop something then why not a calculaor which I was grown up using with. 
# Android Studio
To build the project, going to use android studio. Android Studio contains everything that defines your workspace for an app, from source code and assets, to test code and build configurations.
# Java 
Java is much easier, and it also helps to keep system modular, flexible, and extensible. And for backend using Firebase or SQL.
# Plan for next two Weeks
Planned to design the UI and test it.
